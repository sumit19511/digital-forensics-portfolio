# Metadata Extraction – Sample Forensic Exercise

## Objective
To demonstrate the process of extracting and analyzing metadata from digital files while maintaining forensic integrity.

## Scenario (Simulated)
A set of image and document files were provided for examination to identify:
- Creation and modification timestamps
- Device or software used
- Embedded metadata relevant to an investigation

## Tools Used
- ExifTool
- MediaInfo
- FTK Imager

## Methodology
1. Verified file integrity using hash values
2. Extracted metadata using ExifTool
3. Cross-validated results with MediaInfo
4. Documented findings in a structured format

## Findings (Summary)
- Metadata revealed file origin and modification history
- No evidence of metadata tampering observed
- All analysis performed on copies of original files

## Documentation Notes
- No real or sensitive data was used
